# DuckDuckGo Homepage Clone

</div>

## üìÑ Description

This is a visual clone of the main page of [DuckDuckGo](https://start.duckduckgo.com), focused on replicating its minimalist and privacy-centered design. The goal was to practice clean layout and styling using only vanilla HTML and CSS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (no frameworks)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The toggle menu button does not open the actual menu. It is non-functional and displays a `not-allowed` cursor to indicate that.
- The search bar is static; entering a search term does not return results or redirect anywhere.

## üéì What I Learned

- Layout and alignment using Flexbox
- Working with inline SVGs
- Designing and styling a custom search bar from scratch
- General practice in pixel-perfect UI replication
