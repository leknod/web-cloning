# Web Cloning

**A collection of frontend web clones for learning purposes.**

</div>

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains a series of cloned user interfaces from popular websites. The main goal is to replicate the layout, design, and visual behavior as closely as possible using only frontend technologies. Each project is kept in its own folder and includes its own documentation and code.

These clones are built from scratch and do not contain any backend functionality or real data ‚Äî they are purely for educational and personal development purposes.

## üß† Purpose

Cloning real websites is a hands-on way to:

- Improve layout and positioning skills.
- Practice CSS and responsive design.
- Understand real-world user interface patterns.
- Simulate practical development scenarios.
- Track personal progress and consistency.

## üóÇÔ∏è Organization

Each clone lives in its own folder inside the repository. Every folder is a self-contained project and includes:

- Its own codebase and file structure, depending on the technologies used.
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining what was built, which tools were used, and any relevant notes or limitations.
